# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Feature Extraction, Density Estimation and Bayesian Classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

This part of the project uses a subset of images (with modifications) from the MNIST dataset. The original MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. We use only images for digit “3” and digit “7” in this project. The data is stored in “.mat” files. 

Number of samples in the training set: "3": 5713; "7": 5835 

Number of samples in the testing set : "3": 1428; "7": 1458


We report the error rate of the optimal classifier, for the training set and the testing set respectively where error rate is defined as ratio of number of incorrect predictions to total number of samples.
